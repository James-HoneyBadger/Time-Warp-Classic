Welcome to TimeWarp IDE - A Multi-Language Programming Environment!

This IDE supports: PILOT, BASIC, Logo, Python, JavaScript, and Perl.

Features include:
- Turtle graphics for visual programming
- Multiple themes for different coding environments
- Interactive debugging and code execution
- Plugin system for extensibility

Perl is known for its excellent text processing capabilities!
